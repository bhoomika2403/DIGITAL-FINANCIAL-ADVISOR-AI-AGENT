# DIGITAL-FINANCIAL-ADVISOR-AI-AGENT
An AI Agent for Digital Financial Literacy, powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation), helps users understand and navigate essential financial tools and practices. 
It retrieves reliable content on using UPI, avoiding online scams, understanding interest rates, 
budgeting, and personal finance management from government portals, banking websites, and 
educational platforms. 
With multilingual support, users from diverse backgrounds can interact in their preferred language and 
ask questions like “How do I send money via UPI?” or “What is a safe interest rate for a loan?” 
The agent ensures financial literacy is accessible, personalized, and culturally inclusive. 
This AI-driven assistant empowers users with knowledge, protects them from fraud, and builds 
confidence in digital finance.
